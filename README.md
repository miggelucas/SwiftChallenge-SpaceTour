# Motivation üèãüèª

As a psychology student who has been learning programming, the Swift Student Challenge promoted by Apple was the perfect stimulus to push myself in the pursuit of learning mobile development. Being fond of physics, I sought to build a simple educational app that would demonstrate some astronomical phenomena in a didactic manner. Besides the logical aspect of coding, the graphical part posed a significant challenge. I'm not skilled in illustration; however, I saw the opportunity to express myself artistically through code, even without knowing how to draw. Thus, I had to dedicate myself extensively to learning SwiftUI as a means to give shape to the ideas that existed solely in my mind.

# The Project üì±

Space Tour aims to represent three astronomical phenomena in an intuitive and simplified manner as a means of educating and sparking people's curiosity about nature.

1. Solar System: It seeks to demonstrate the organization and the planetary movements around the Sun.
2. Lunar System: It aims to demonstrate how the moon's movement around the Earth modifies our perception of the reflected sunlight, resulting in the phases of the moon that we are familiar with.
3. Tidal System: It aims to demonstrate how the moon's movement influences the gravitational field of the Earth, creating zones of greater attraction and generating tidal differences based on the lunar position.
